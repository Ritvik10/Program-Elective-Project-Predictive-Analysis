# Program-Elective-Project-Predictive-Analysis

The project has been made as part of the Program Elective Subject in my 5th semester. The subject is Data Analytics Specialization and the domain is Predictive Analysis. The GitHub repository has an ipynb file which has all the working on the Cancer dataset which I got on Kaggle. I have used SVM in order to find the accuracy of the model and used accuracy metrics like confusion Matrix and classification report to ultimately determine the accuracy. Certain improvising methods of hyperparameter tuning have also been used to increase the accuracy of the model. 

The repository also includes a file report which has all the details of the working on the dataset.
